CHAPTER: OLIGOPOLY

Definition:
Oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of large firms dominate the market.

Key Characteristics:
- Few dominant firms
- High barriers to entry
- Interdependence between firms
- Price rigidity (sticky prices)

Interdependence:
Firms in an oligopoly are interdependent, meaning the actions of one firm affect the others.

Price Rigidity:
Prices tend to remain stable because firms fear price wars if they change prices.

- Automobile industry

Exam Tips:
