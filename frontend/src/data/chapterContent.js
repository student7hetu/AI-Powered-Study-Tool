CHAPTER: OLIGOPOLY

Definition:
Oligopoly is a market structure where a small number of large firms dominate the market.

Main Characteristics:
- Few dominant firms
- High barriers to entry
- Firms are interdependent
- Prices tend to be rigid

Interdependence:
In an oligopoly, firms are closely connected.
Any price or output decision by one firm affects the others.

Price Rigidity:
Prices usually remain stable because firms fear price wars.
If one firm changes price, competitors are likely to react.

Examples:

- Airline industry
- Automobile industry

Exam Tips:

- Use real-world examples
- Mention the kinked demand curve when explaining price rigidity
